# DigitalDoily
This is my first project in java where I used the graphic libraries in order to produce an app that allows the user to draw a digital doily. As additional functionality I added the option to enable or disable the guiding lines of the sectors, to change the size and colour of the pen and also to toggle on or off the reflection of the points.
